##Summary

Rat hole avoided!  For now at least, we manage to get the clock mechanisms to match our early engine design ideas, implementing the observable patterns that distinguish our engine from being a _ticking_ time bomb.  In order to test the clock we defer decisions about the scheduler, which is conciously isolated to allow us to unit test the clock in it's entirety.

We then move on to the scheduler... This class is so buried in thread synchronisation that we have no choice but to forego our Unit Testing, instead bringing in high-level integration testing.  We don't get the scheduler finished, but we take a good chunk out of it ready for the next session.
