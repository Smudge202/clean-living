##Summary

Refactoring the whole thing!

@herecydev makes a good point about how it is impossible for a game component subscribing for a given game time, can know why it subscribed when the associated notification is returned.  What we need is the ability to pass state as part of the subscription, which is then returned to the component when the subscription is fulfilled.

This is no small task.  For 4 hours I dig away at the innards of the engine and finally piece it back together with the new design implemented.  Tests are updated to resolve compilation errors resulting from method signature changes, and slowly but surely we follow through all failing tests to a working engine, that we can have absolute confidence in.  All behaviour defined before the refactor, we know still works.

There's still a tidy up to be done on the branch, but we now have an engine that will support the first stages of our actual game!
