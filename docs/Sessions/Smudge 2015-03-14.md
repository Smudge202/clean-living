##Summary

Multithreaded madness! 

With only some high level integration tests in place, we dig in to the scheduler implementation. I talk about many thread synchronisation mechanisms available through .Net, then end up utilising a large portion of them to get this class to conform to the expected behaviours.

We see some racing conditions as well as issues with the test runner with respect to background threads terminating.  I provide tips for debugging multithreaded scenarios, and lengthy explanations on just how the broad array of synchronisation techniques come together to achieve our goal.

Our tests do us proud in the fine tradition of clean coding, spotting what would otherwise be an incredibly difficult issue to locate in production, and for added measure our Continuous Integration platform then does the same for a racing condition my local environment never experienced!

This... This right here ladies and gents, is why we test!
