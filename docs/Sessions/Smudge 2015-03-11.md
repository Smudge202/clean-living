#Stream Session Write-up

##Summary

First stream, first steps!

We talked a little about some of the early concepts that need to be addressed and started our first task.  The issues we had outlined in github involved looking at how to track the health of an entity.  However, we found this to be tied to so many other components, its a bit of a nuance to pick as a first task.

Whilst talking about how we want the engine structure and API to look going forward, we decided that the best place to actually start was on the engine itself.

After a fair amount of to and fro with the team, we decided upon a _tick_ system, which we then set about implementing.  As with the early stages of any complex projects, fundamental decisions were changed as quickly as they were decided.

Towards the end of the session I handed over the reigns to [herecydev], but as can be seen from the discussion on the [pull request] for the session, mistakes have been made!
