# Clean Living

Walking a mile in the shoes of a game developer.

## Description

_Clean Living_ is another drop in the pool that is the survival game genre.  The difference between this game and others is that our end-goal is not to publish the game and become overnight millionaires (though if you want to send us millions, let me know!).

Instead, our emphasis is on having fun and learning. In particular, we're not aiming for just collaborators and contributors to learn from this project, we intend for our group of software professionals to stream the majority of the game's development, demonstrating and putting into practice our broad range of industry leading practices, experience and knowledge.

## What to expect

All collaborators on this project are strong advocates of [clean code] and [agile], and as such will be demonstrating best practices, talking about object-orientated-programming design patterns, SOLID principals, SCRUM methodology, and so forth.

We'll be taking questions and feedback, where possible helping to put developers new to these concepts on the right track.

## Contributions

The initial collborators all know one another offline, but we're by no means a closed net group. We remain open to suggestions and pull-request contributions to the project.

Our only condition is that Pull-Requests follow the same agile clean-code format on which the project is based!  Pull-Requests that don't quite meet the mark we will endeavour to provide constructive feedback in order to remedy any faults and continue the merge.  Pull-Requests falling too far short will simply be declined, though we invite the authors to ask for help and try again.
